  // 3. Price Manipulation: Filter out products without prices, convert string prices to numbers, and calculate the total price using reduce.

  // 4. Concatenate Product Names: Use reduce to concatenate all product names into a single string.
  // 5. Find Extremes in Prices: Identify the highest and lowest-priced items, returning a string formatted as "Highest: X. Lowest: Y."
  // 6. Object Transformation: Using Object.entries and reduce, recreate the products object with keys 'name' and 'cost', maintaining their original values.
